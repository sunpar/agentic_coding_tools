description: Frontend rules for Vite React TS with Ant Design, React Router, MST, and TanStack Query
globs:
  - frontend/src/**/*.ts
  - frontend/src/**/*.tsx
alwaysApply: false

# Frontend architecture rules
- UI components: use Ant Design first; avoid adding a second component library.
- Routing: React Router; keep pages in `src/pages/*` and route config in `src/app/router.tsx`.
- Server state: TanStack Query owns server caching, retries, loading states.
- Client state: MobX State Tree for app/UI state only (e.g., layout, preferences). Do NOT duplicate server state into MST.

# TypeScript standards
- No `any` unless absolutely necessary (add a comment explaining why).
- Prefer small typed modules: `src/api/*` for HTTP, `src/components/*` for reusable UI, `src/pages/*` for routes.
- Keep API payloads typed (prefer generated OpenAPI types if available).

# UI/UX rules
- Prefer AntD `Form` + `Form.Item` for forms and validation.
- Dates: be consistent. Prefer ISO strings over locale strings in API boundaries.

# Verification
Run: `cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build`
